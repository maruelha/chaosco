# Build Plan

The single to-do document. Two halves: **feature work by module** (the dashboard
cards) and **refactoring steps** (numbered — "do refactoring step 1" means exactly
what is written under that number).

Sources consolidated here: `docs/project_review_2026-07-04.md` (cleanup plan),
`retail-tracker-handoff.md` (tracker spec + decisions), `docs/tech_backlog.md`.
When an item here is done: mark it done here AND update the source doc.

## Part 1 — Feature work by module

### Retail Requirements Tracker (`/retail-tracker/board`)

1. **Override button — "counted as done by decision"** *(= step 5.1 of the
   tracker plan)*. Per requirement × country: mark as counted WITHOUT a test
   pass, with a MANDATORY reason. Board shows it visibly as a decision (not a
   real pass — distinct chip style + reason on hover). Table `tested_overrides`
   already exists (requirement_id, country, reason NOT NULL); counting service
   already consumes it (`overrides_by_req`) — only the UI action + a small
   route are missing. Payment methods need NO overrides (the check-off system
   is their human layer).
2. **Historical yes-marks comparison** *(= step 5.2)*. One-time script/page:
   read the Excel's per-country yes-columns (tabs 1–3), compare against the
   live board, list differences. For each difference the user decides: already
   covered by a Passed status (ignore) or import as override with reason
   "migrated from Excel 2026-07".
3. **Retire the tracking Excel** *(= step 5.3)*. After 1+2: the board is the
   single source of truth; stop maintaining the Excel. Remove/repurpose the
   one-time import button (keep re-import possible but clearly labelled).
4. Cosmetic backlog: the Excel names the same test twice (Blind Return /
   OFFLINE Return → GKP2002; Blind Return giftcard / Blind return → GKP1015)
   → two near-duplicate Return rows. Fix the names in the Excel and re-import,
   or add an ignore mechanism.

### Inbox (`/inbox`)

1. Screenshot-first capture (attach before saving a note) — "maybe" in
   `docs/tech_backlog.md`; silent AJAX-create approach sketched there.

### Reports / Export (dashboard "Export Reports" button)

1. ~~**Fix the broken button**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-04 (with refactoring step 1):
   `app/report_exporter.py` writes `.html` + `.pptx` via the existing PPT
   builders; dead PDF code (`pdf_utils.py`, `/spillover/report/pdf`) deleted.
2. ~~**Email reports**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-04: `/email-report` — GMX SMTP,
   per-report checkboxes, DB-managed recipients, date-driven subject/text.
   Future option: `email_transport: n8n_webhook` switch if distribution
   grows (Teams, schedules).

### ECOM vertical (planned, not started)

1. New importer + `ecom` + `ecom_annotations` tables + UI, following the
   Retail vertical as template (per CLAUDE.md). Excel tab name TBD.
   **Precondition: refactoring step 3 (notes consolidation) first** — otherwise
   the note routes get copy-pasted an 11th time.

### Omni vertical (planned, not started)

1. Same as ECOM, after ECOM.

### Follow-ups

1. ~~**Teams ping**~~ ✅ DONE 2026-07-04: deep-link button on list + detail —
   opens a pre-filled Teams chat (1:1 or group via comma-separated emails);
   recipient auto-matched from contacts. Deep links cannot target existing
   named/meeting chats or pre-fill channels — if that is ever needed, the
   Power Automate webhook route (VDI-created, cloud-run) is the upgrade path.

### Jira card (CONCEPT NOT YET CLEAR — do not build)

Parked 2026-07-04 after a feasibility chat. Known so far:
- Source: Jira **XML export** (issue search → Export → XML) — unlike CSV it
  includes the full comment thread (author, timestamp, HTML body). ~1000-issue
  cap per export. Python stdlib ElementTree reads it fine, no new deps.
- Architecture (per the existing future-integration rule): own tables
  (`jira_issues` upserted by key + `jira_comments` replaced per import),
  NEVER merged into Excel-sourced tables. Importer mirrors the Excel pattern
  (newest matching file in downloads_folder, first_seen/last_seen).
- Card sketch: filterable list; detail with description + comment thread
  (rendered HTML) + open-in-Jira link + notes module + inbox filing.
- Before building: Marina defines the concept; then ONE real sample XML
  export to pin the parser + tests against.

### Cross-module navigation

1. Make `defect_id_ref` on Retail rows a clickable link to the Defect detail.
2. Clarify or consolidate the two follow-up trackers (`followups` vs
   `cs_followups`).

## Part 2 — Refactoring steps (do in order; each is one instruction)

> From `docs/project_review_2026-07-04.md`. Each step is shippable on its own;
> the app keeps running throughout. "Do refactoring step N" = do exactly the
> bullet list under N, nothing more.

### Refactoring step 1 — Hygiene pass ✅ DONE 2026-07-04

- Untrack committed junk (files stay on disk, leave git):
  `git rm --cached` for: `archive_db/*.db`, `archive/test_coordination.db`,
  `archive/test_coordinationSpillOver.db`, `data/Neuer Ordner/` (both .db),
  `data/spillover_annotations_export_*.json`, `output/~$retail_report_log.xlsx`,
  `config/settings.local.yaml`
- Extend `.gitignore`: `archive_db/`, `archive/*.db`, `data/**/*.db`,
  `~$*`, `config/settings.local.yaml`, `report_export/` (verify present)
- Move the nine `claude_code_prompt_*.md` root files to `docs/history/`
- Delete dead PDF code: `app/pdf_utils.py`, the `/spillover/report/pdf` route
  in `web.py` + its `render_pdf` import; either fix `report_exporter.py`
  (HTML-only for now) or disable the dashboard Export Reports button with a
  clear "being reworked" message
- Pin `requirements.txt` to exact versions (`pip freeze` for the 5 deps)
- Remove the one-time dep-cleanup block from `run_web.bat`
- Delete stray temp files: `output/~$…`, `report_export/~$…`, `Download/~$…`
- **Done when:** `git status` clean-by-intent, app starts, all tests green.

### Refactoring step 2 — Test safety net ✅ DONE 2026-07-04

- `tests/` exists (tracker suite, 33 tests). Add:
  - Characterization tests for the three existing importers
    (`read_defects`, `spillover_importer`, `retail_importer`): synthetic
    Excel fixture in, assert exact DB rows out (incl. skip/dedup edge cases,
    `first_seen`/`last_seen` idempotency)
  - Route smoke test: every GET route in `web.py` + tracker returns 200
    against a temp copy of the DB
- **Done when:** `python -m pytest` covers importers + routes, all green.

### Refactoring step 3 — Notes consolidation ✅ DONE 2026-07-04

- One generic note route set in a new file (e.g. `app/web_notes.py`,
  Blueprint): add/edit/delete for ALL entity types, driven by a small
  registry {entity_type → label, detail-url builder, db-getter}
- One shared template include `app/templates/_notes_section.html`
  (note list + form + attachments)
- One shared `app/static/notes.js` (upload, delete, Ctrl+V paste) replacing
  the ~9 inlined copies
- Migrate each module to the shared pieces one at a time (defects → retail →
  spillover → followups → shelf → test_learnings → ecom_gatekeeper →
  test_limitations → cs_followups → meeting_prep/todos), deleting the old
  routes/JS per module as it switches; smoke tests stay green after each
- **Done when:** zero per-module note routes left in `web.py`; the paste JS
  exists exactly once.

### Refactoring step 4 — Split the monoliths ✅ DONE 2026-07-04

- `web.py` → flat `app/web_*.py` feature modules (home, defects, spillover,
  retail, reports, planning, reference) sharing the app object from
  `web_core.py` — NOT Blueprints for the old routes, deliberately: Blueprint
  endpoints are name-prefixed and would have broken every url_for in ~40
  templates. New verticals (tracker, notes) stay Blueprints. `web.py` is now
  the assembler (imports route modules + registers blueprints).
- `database.py` (2,800+ lines) → package `app/db/` (defects.py, retail.py,
  spillover.py, notes.py, coordination.py, schema.py) with `app/database.py`
  re-exporting everything so no caller breaks
- Mechanical moves only — no logic changes; tests green after every move
- **Done when:** no file in `app/` exceeds ~600 lines; `from app import
  database` still works everywhere.

### Refactoring step 5 — Docs & CLAUDE.md split ✅ DONE 2026-07-04

- Split CLAUDE.md: lean core (rules, stack, key files) + `docs/claude/`
  per-vertical files (defects, retail, tracker, coordination, ecom-when-built)
- Fix docs drift: document `solman_sync.py` + `/solman-sync` (key files +
  screens tables), add `main.py`/`archiver.py` to key files
- Rewrite `README.md` for what the app is today (web UI first, correct
  install incl. flask + python-pptx)
- Mark `docs/code-review-findings.md` findings as resolved / archive it
- **Done when:** CLAUDE.md under ~150 lines; README matches reality.

### Refactoring step 6 — UI component library ✅ DONE 2026-07-04

- `app/templates/_macros.html`: shared Jinja macros — page header (title +
  action buttons), filter bar, data table shell, pills/badges, stat cards,
  result box — so every module's UI is assembled from the same components
- Consolidate the repeated inline `<style>` blocks into `style.css`
  component classes (one visual language; new modules inherit it)
- Replace hardcoded `href="/..."` in templates with `url_for(...)` wherever
  a template is touched
- Migrate templates opportunistically (each template switched = old markup
  deleted), starting with the list pages that share the most structure
- **Done when:** a new module's list+detail UI can be built from macros
  without copying HTML from a sibling template.

### Follow-ups discovered during the refactor

- `docs/architecture.html` and `docs/database_schema.html` describe the
  pre-refactor layout — regenerate when convenient (CLAUDE.md + docs/claude/
  are current in the meantime).
- `app/db/reference.py` (770 lines) and `app/web_reference.py` (652) are the
  two largest files — both are stacks of small independent CRUD groups;
  split further only if they keep growing.
- `config/settings.local.yaml` REPLACES settings.yaml instead of merging —
  intuitive-merge behavior would be nicer (small config_loader change).

### Conditional (not scheduled)

- Generic CRUD repository for the simple entities (links, contacts, todos, …)
  — only worth it when the NEXT simple entity gets added; don't do it for
  elegance alone (review recommendation).
